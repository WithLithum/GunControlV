<!--
  This is the ruleset file of the Gun Control.
  As you can see, the rules are made of three parts:
  
  - A RuleName indicates which rule to check
  - A Condition indicates in what condition it will run
  - A DoesClear indicates whether the mod processes that ped if matched
  
  The "False" option of the DoesClear overrides all options, means the LevelOfArmed
  etc. will not be respected whenever DoesClear is set to false to a Cop condition.
  
  There are two conditions available:
  
  - Cop: Applies to cops. If condition "True" the rule applies to cops; otherwise applies to every ped that is not cop
  - GangMember: If condition "True" the rule applies to gang members; otherwise applies to every ped that is not gang member
  
  Note that having too many rules will slow down GunControl processing speed, thus decreasing FPS.
  It is recommended that you set a reasonable interval between each ped to increase frame rate.
